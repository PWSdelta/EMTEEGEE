# AI Analysis Swarm System

## Architecture

### Central Server (Micro VM)
- Django web interface
- MongoDB for card storage
- Redis for work queues
- RESTful API for worker communication

### Worker Nodes
- **Desktop (RTX 3070, 64GB)**: Fast 8B models on GPU
  - Components: play_tips, rules_clarifications, combo_suggestions, format_analysis
- **Laptop (128GB, CPU)**: Large 70B models 
  - Components: thematic_analysis, historical_context, design_philosophy, advanced_interactions

### Work Distribution Strategy
```
High-Speed Components (Desktop GPU):
- play_tips
- mulligan_considerations  
- rules_clarifications
- combo_suggestions
- format_analysis
- synergy_analysis
- competitive_analysis
- tactical_analysis

Deep Analysis Components (Laptop CPU):
- thematic_analysis
- historical_context
- art_flavor_analysis
- design_philosophy
- advanced_interactions
- meta_positioning

Balanced Components (Either):
- budget_alternatives
- deck_archetypes
- new_player_guide
- sideboard_guide
- power_level_assessment
- investment_outlook
```
