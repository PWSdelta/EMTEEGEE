🚀 ENHANCED SWARM API DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - PRODUCTION READY
========================================================

SITUATION: Your production server (mtgabyss.com) needs the enhanced swarm API to work with
the new universal_worker_enhanced.py v3.0.

CONFIRMED: 
✅ Enhanced swarm API works locally (tested)
✅ Code committed and pushed to GitHub
❌ Production server still missing enhanced swarm API (returns 502 Bad Gateway)

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
================

1. 📥 PULL LATEST CODE ON PRODUCTION SERVER
   -----------------------------------------
   ssh into your production server and run:
   
   cd /path/to/your/emteegee/project
   git pull origin main
   
   This will download:
   - cards/enhanced_swarm_api.py       (New enhanced API endpoints)
   - cards/enhanced_api_urls.py        (URL routing for enhanced API)
   - cards/enhanced_swarm_manager.py   (Smart prioritization engine)
   - cards/swarm_logging.py           (Standardized logging)
   - cards/coherence_manager.py       (Cross-component validation)
   - emteegee/urls.py                 (Updated with enhanced routes)

2. 🔧 VERIFY URL CONFIGURATION
   ----------------------------
   Ensure your production emteegee/urls.py contains:
   
   path('api/enhanced_swarm/', include('cards.enhanced_api_urls')),
   
   This should already be included after the git pull.

3. 🗄️ DATABASE REQUIREMENTS
   -------------------------
   The enhanced system uses the same MongoDB collections but with enhanced queries.
   No schema changes required - it's backward compatible.

4. 📦 INSTALL DEPENDENCIES (if needed)
   -----------------------------------
   The enhanced system uses the same dependencies as the original swarm system.
   If you encounter import errors, ensure these are installed:
   
   pip install pymongo django bson ollama

4.1 🗂️ CREATE REQUIRED LOG FILES
    ------------------------------
    The enhanced system expects certain log files to exist:
    
    # Create logs directory if it doesn't exist
    mkdir -p logs
    
    # Create blank log files (they will be populated automatically)
    touch logs/swarm.log
    touch logs/enhanced_swarm.log
   
5. 🔄 RESTART SERVICES
   --------------------
   After pulling the code, restart your Django application:
   
   # For systemd services:
   sudo systemctl restart your-django-service
   
   # For uwsgi/nginx:
   sudo systemctl restart uwsgi
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   
   # For Docker:
   docker-compose restart web

6. ✅ VERIFY DEPLOYMENT
   --------------------
   Test these URLs to confirm the enhanced API is working:
   
   curl https://mtgabyss.com/api/enhanced_swarm/status
   
   Expected response (JSON):
   {
     "workers": {"total": X, "active": Y, "offline": Z},
     "tasks": {"pending": N, "completed": M},
     "cards": {"total": 29448, "analyzed": XXXX, "completion_rate": "XX.X%"},
     "enhancements": {
       "smart_prioritization": true,
       "batch_processing": true,
       "coherence_validation": true
     }
   }

WHAT'S NEW IN ENHANCED SWARM API v2.0:
=====================================

🎯 Smart Prioritization
- EDHREC popularity-based task assignment
- High-value cards get priority processing
- Efficient worker allocation

🔄 Batch Processing  
- Multiple cards processed together
- Reduced database overhead
- Better throughput

🛡️ Coherence Validation
- Cross-component consistency checking
- Quality assurance for analysis
- Automatic error detection

📊 Enhanced Monitoring
- Real-time worker health tracking
- Detailed system metrics
- Performance analytics

🏗️ Production Ready
- Robust error handling
- Comprehensive logging
- Scalable architecture

ENDPOINTS AVAILABLE:
===================

/api/enhanced_swarm/status         - System status and metrics
/api/enhanced_swarm/register       - Worker registration
/api/enhanced_swarm/get_work       - Get prioritized work assignments
/api/enhanced_swarm/submit_results - Submit completed analysis
/api/enhanced_swarm/heartbeat      - Worker health monitoring
/api/enhanced_swarm/workers        - Worker health dashboard
/api/enhanced_swarm/metrics        - Detailed system metrics

WORKER COMPATIBILITY:
====================

✅ universal_worker_enhanced.py v3.0 - Full compatibility
✅ All 20 analysis components supported
✅ GPU/CPU worker specialization
✅ Smart task prioritization
✅ Enhanced error handling

TESTING COMMANDS:
================

After deployment, run these tests:

# Test API availability on production (port 8000)
curl https://mtgabyss.com/api/enhanced_swarm/status

# For local testing (port 8000 - standard Django)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/enhanced_swarm/status

# Test worker registration (from worker machine)
python universal_worker_enhanced.py https://mtgabyss.com

# For local worker testing
python universal_worker_enhanced.py http://localhost:8000

⚠️ PORT CONFIGURATION:
- Production server: Standard port (80/443 via nginx)
- Local development: Port 8000 (Django default)
- Port 8001 was used during development/testing only

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

🔴 502 Bad Gateway:
   - Django app not running or crashed
   - Check logs: sudo journalctl -u your-django-service
   - Restart services

🔴 404 Not Found:
   - URL routing not configured
   - Check emteegee/urls.py includes enhanced_api_urls
   - Restart Django after URL changes

🔴 500 Internal Server Error:
   - Import errors or missing dependencies
   - Check Django logs for traceback
   - Verify all new files are present

🔴 MongoDB Connection Issues:
   - Ensure MongoDB is running
   - Check connection settings
   - Verify network access

⚠️ PORT CONFIGURATION NOTE:
===========================
During development/testing, some scripts may reference port 8001.
For production deployment:
- Production server: Uses standard HTTP/HTTPS ports via nginx
- Local development: Use port 8000 (Django default)
- Worker registration: Will auto-detect correct port
- API endpoints work on any port Django is running on

SUPPORT:
========

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Django logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify all files were pulled from git
3. Confirm URL routing is correct
4. Test MongoDB connectivity
5. Ensure all dependencies are installed

Once deployed, workers will be able to:
✅ Register with remote production server
✅ Receive prioritized work assignments  
✅ Submit analysis results with validation
✅ Participate in distributed AI analysis

🎯 GOAL: Deploy enhanced swarm API to enable distributed worker network
