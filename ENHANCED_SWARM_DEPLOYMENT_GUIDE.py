üöÄ ENHANCED SWARM API DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - PRODUCTION READY
========================================================

SITUATION: Your production server (mtgabyss.com) needs the enhanced swarm API to work with
the new universal_worker_enhanced.py v3.0.

CONFIRMED: 
‚úÖ Enhanced swarm API works locally (tested)
‚úÖ Code committed and pushed to GitHub
‚úÖ Nginx configuration updated for enhanced API endpoints
‚úÖ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - Enhanced API is LIVE!
‚úÖ Production enhanced API verified: https://mtgabyss.com/api/enhanced_swarm/status
‚úÖ Worker registration with https://mtgabyss.com CONFIRMED!
‚úÖ All 20 analysis components successfully assigned
‚úÖ Enhanced swarm system v2.0 FULLY OPERATIONAL
‚úÖ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! üéâ

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
================

1. üì• PULL LATEST CODE ON PRODUCTION SERVER
   -----------------------------------------
   ssh into your production server and run:
   
   cd /path/to/your/emteegee/project
   git pull origin main
   
   This will download:
   - cards/enhanced_swarm_api.py       (New enhanced API endpoints)
   - cards/enhanced_api_urls.py        (URL routing for enhanced API)
   - cards/enhanced_swarm_manager.py   (Smart prioritization engine)
   - cards/swarm_logging.py           (Standardized logging)
   - cards/coherence_manager.py       (Cross-component validation)
   - emteegee/urls.py                 (Updated with enhanced routes)

2. üîß VERIFY URL CONFIGURATION
   ----------------------------
   Ensure your production emteegee/urls.py contains:
   
   path('api/enhanced_swarm/', include('cards.enhanced_api_urls')),
   
   This should already be included after the git pull.

3. üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE REQUIREMENTS
   -------------------------
   The enhanced system uses the same MongoDB collections but with enhanced queries.
   No schema changes required - it's backward compatible.

4. üì¶ INSTALL DEPENDENCIES (if needed)
   -----------------------------------
   The enhanced system uses the same dependencies as the original swarm system.
   If you encounter import errors, ensure these are installed:
   
   pip install pymongo django bson ollama

4.1 üóÇÔ∏è CREATE REQUIRED LOG FILES
    ------------------------------
    The enhanced system expects certain log files to exist:
    
    # Create logs directory if it doesn't exist
    mkdir -p logs
    
    # Create blank log files (they will be populated automatically)
    touch logs/swarm.log
    touch logs/enhanced_swarm.log
   
5. üîÑ RESTART SERVICES
   --------------------
   After pulling the code, restart your Django application:
   
   # For systemd services:
   sudo systemctl restart your-django-service
   
   # For uwsgi/nginx:
   sudo systemctl restart uwsgi
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   
   # For Docker:
   docker-compose restart web

5.1 üåê NGINX CONFIGURATION (IMPORTANT)
    -----------------------------------
    Ensure your nginx sites-available configuration includes:
    
    location /api/enhanced_swarm/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000/api/enhanced_swarm/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
    
    After updating nginx config:
    # Test configuration
    sudo nginx -t
    
    # Restart nginx if test passes
    sudo systemctl restart nginx

6. ‚úÖ VERIFY DEPLOYMENT
   --------------------
   Test these URLs to confirm the enhanced API is working:
   
   curl https://mtgabyss.com/api/enhanced_swarm/status
   
   Expected response (JSON):
   {
     "workers": {"total": X, "active": Y, "offline": Z},
     "tasks": {"pending": N, "completed": M},
     "cards": {"total": 29448, "analyzed": XXXX, "completion_rate": "XX.X%"},
     "enhancements": {
       "smart_prioritization": true,
       "batch_processing": true,
       "coherence_validation": true
     }
   }

WORKER COMMANDS - FINAL VERSION:
=================================

# üåê PRODUCTION WORKER (default - connects to mtgabyss.com):
python universal_worker_enhanced.py

# ÔøΩ PRODUCTION WORKER (explicit):
python universal_worker_enhanced.py https://mtgabyss.com

# üè† LOCAL DEVELOPMENT WORKER (when needed):
python universal_worker_enhanced.py http://localhost:8000

- ‚úÖ Registers with server and gets 20 analysis components
- ‚úÖ Starts continuous work polling loop (every 3 seconds for desktop)
- ‚úÖ Sends heartbeat to maintain connection
- ‚úÖ Processes tasks and submits results
- ‚úÖ Handles max concurrent tasks (2 for desktop worker)
- ‚úÖ Graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C

TESTING COMMANDS:
================

After deployment, run these tests:

# Test API availability on production (port 8000)
curl https://mtgabyss.com/api/enhanced_swarm/status

# For local testing (port 8000 - standard Django)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/enhanced_swarm/status

# Test worker registration (from worker machine)
python universal_worker_enhanced.py https://mtgabyss.com

# For local worker testing
python universal_worker_enhanced.py http://localhost:8000

‚ö†Ô∏è PORT CONFIGURATION:
- Production server: Standard port (80/443 via nginx)
- Local development: Port 8000 (Django default)
- Port 8001 was used during development/testing only

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

üî¥ 502 Bad Gateway:
   - Django app not running or crashed
   - Check logs: sudo journalctl -u your-django-service
   - Restart services

üî¥ 404 Not Found:
   - URL routing not configured
   - Check emteegee/urls.py includes enhanced_api_urls
   - Restart Django after URL changes

üî¥ 500 Internal Server Error:
   - Import errors or missing dependencies
   - Check Django logs for traceback
   - Verify all new files are present

üî¥ MongoDB Connection Issues:
   - Ensure MongoDB is running
   - Check connection settings
   - Verify network access

‚ö†Ô∏è PORT CONFIGURATION NOTE:
===========================
During development/testing, some scripts may reference port 8001.
For production deployment:
- Production server: Uses standard HTTP/HTTPS ports via nginx
- Local development: Use port 8000 (Django default)
- Worker registration: Will auto-detect correct port
- API endpoints work on any port Django is running on

SUPPORT:
========

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Django logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify all files were pulled from git
3. Confirm URL routing is correct
4. Test MongoDB connectivity
5. Ensure all dependencies are installed

Once deployed, workers will be able to:
‚úÖ Register with remote production server
‚úÖ Receive prioritized work assignments  
‚úÖ Submit analysis results with validation
‚úÖ Participate in distributed AI analysis

üéØ GOAL: Deploy enhanced swarm API to enable distributed worker network
