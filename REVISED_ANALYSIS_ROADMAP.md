## Technical Implementation

### Key Files for Analysis Platform
- **Models**: `cards/models.py` - MongoDB queries for analysis data
- **Views**: `cards/views.py` - Analysis display logic
- **Templates**: `templates/cards/card_detail.html` - Analysis presentation
- **URLs**: `cards/urls.py` - Analysis-specific routes
- **Static**: Analysis-specific CSS/JS for rich presentation

### Database Schema (Current)
```javascript
// Analyzed card structure
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "name": "Card Name",
  "mana_cost": "{1}{U}",
  "oracle_text": "...",
  "analysis": {
    "fully_analyzed": true,
    "component_count": 20,
    "analysis_started_at": ISODate,
    "analysis_completed_at": ISODate,
    "components": {
      "play_tips": {
        "content": "...",
        "model_used": "llama3.2:latest",
        "created_at": ISODate,
        "word_count": 290,
        "tokens_used": 374
      },
      // ... 19 more components
    }
  }

## Getting Started Checklist

1. **Verify Analysis Data**:
   ```python
   # Test analysis content access
   db.cards.find_one({"analysis.fully_analyzed": True})
   ```

2. **Current Analysis Stats**: 82 fully analyzed cards out of 29,448

3. **Priority Focus**: 
   - Build analysis browsing interface
   - Showcase the rich AI-generated content
   - Make analysis data easily discoverable

4. **Files to Start With**:
