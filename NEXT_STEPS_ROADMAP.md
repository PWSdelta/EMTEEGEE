# EMTEEGEE Next Steps Development Roadmap

## Current Status âœ…
- **MongoDB Integration**: Successfully connected and configured MongoDB for deck storage
- **Deck Import**: Imported 2,466 MTG decks from MTGJSON format into MongoDB
- **Code Organization**: Cleaned up project structure and added comprehensive .gitignore
- **Git Repository**: Successfully committed and pushed changes to GitHub

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority 1)

### 1. Deck Data Validation & Cleanup
- [ ] **Remove Invalid Decks**: Run script to delete decks with <60 cards from MongoDB
- [ ] **Deck Statistics**: Generate stats on imported decks (format distribution, card counts, etc.)
- [ ] **Data Integrity**: Verify all deck data is properly formatted and complete

### 2. Deck Browsing & Display Interface
- [ ] **Deck List View**: Complete `templates/cards/deck_list.html` with:
  - Pagination for large deck collections
  - Search and filter functionality (by format, colors, deck size)
  - Sort options (name, format, creation date, deck size)
  - Deck preview cards with key information
  
- [ ] **Deck Detail View**: Enhance `templates/cards/deck_detail.html` with:
  - Complete card list with quantities
  - Mana curve visualization
  - Color identity display
  - Format legality information
  - Export options (text, MTGO, Arena formats)

### 3. URL Routing & Views
- [ ] **Update `cards/urls.py`**: Add routes for:
  ```python
  path('decks/', views.deck_list, name='deck_list'),
  path('decks/<str:deck_id>/', views.deck_detail, name='deck_detail'),
  path('decks/format/<str:format>/', views.decks_by_format, name='decks_by_format'),
  ```

- [ ] **Complete View Functions**: Implement in `cards/views.py`:
  - `deck_list()`: Query MongoDB for deck listing with filters
  - `deck_detail()`: Fetch individual deck data
  - `decks_by_format()`: Filter decks by Magic format

## Medium-Term Development (Priority 2)

### 4. Advanced Deck Features
- [ ] **Deck Analysis**: 
  - Card synergy detection
  - Mana curve analysis
  - Archetype classification
  - Power level estimation

- [ ] **Deck Comparison**:
  - Side-by-side deck comparison tool
  - Card overlap analysis
  - Statistical differences

- [ ] **Deck Search & Filters**:
  - Advanced search by card names
  - Filter by color combinations
  - Filter by format legality
  - Filter by deck themes/archetypes

### 5. Integration with Existing Card System
- [ ] **Card-Deck Relationships**: Link existing card data with deck contents
- [ ] **Enhanced Card Details**: Show "Decks containing this card" on card pages
- [ ] **Card Popularity**: Calculate card usage statistics across decks

### 6. User Features
- [ ] **Favorites System**: Allow users to favorite decks
- [ ] **Deck Collections**: Let users create custom deck collections
- [ ] **Deck Import**: Allow users to import their own decks
- [ ] **Deck Export**: Multiple export formats (MTGO, Arena, text)

## Long-Term Features (Priority 3)

### 7. Advanced Analytics
- [ ] **Meta Analysis**: Track popular cards/strategies across formats
- [ ] **Trend Analysis**: See how deck compositions change over time
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: If tournament data available, analyze win rates

### 8. AI/ML Integration
- [ ] **Deck Recommendation**: Suggest similar decks based on viewing history
- [ ] **Card Suggestions**: Recommend cards for existing decks
- [ ] **Archetype Detection**: Automatically classify deck archetypes

### 9. API Endpoints
- [ ] **Deck API**: RESTful endpoints for deck data
- [ ] **Search API**: Programmatic deck search
- [ ] **Export API**: Bulk deck export capabilities

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Schema (MongoDB Collections)
```javascript
// Current deck collection structure
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "name": "Deck Name",
  "format": "Standard/Modern/Legacy/etc",
  "cards": [
    {
      "name": "Card Name",
      "quantity": 1,
      "type": "main/side"
    }
  ],
  "colors": ["W", "U", "B", "R", "G"],
  "total_cards": 60,
  "created_date": ISODate,
  "source": "mtgjson"
}
```

### Key Files to Work With
- **Models**: `cards/models.py` - MongoDB connection and deck queries
- **Views**: `cards/views.py` - Deck list/detail view logic
- **Templates**: `templates/cards/deck_*.html` - Frontend deck display
- **URLs**: `cards/urls.py` - Route definitions
- **Static Assets**: `static/css/` and `static/js/` - Styling and interactivity

### Required Python Packages (already in requirements.txt)
- `pymongo` - MongoDB driver
- `django` - Web framework
- `requests` - HTTP requests for data fetching

## Deployment Considerations
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Ensure MongoDB credentials are properly configured
- [ ] **Static Files**: Configure static file serving for production
- [ ] **Database Backup**: Implement MongoDB backup strategy
- [ ] **Performance**: Add database indexes for frequently queried fields

## Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Testing**: Write tests for deck-related functionality
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update README with deck browsing features
- [ ] **Code Review**: Ensure MongoDB queries are efficient
- [ ] **Security**: Validate all user inputs for deck searches

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Deck browsing interface loads within 2 seconds
- [ ] Users can successfully filter decks by format and colors
- [ ] Deck detail pages display complete card lists accurately
- [ ] Search functionality returns relevant results quickly

## Getting Started Checklist for Next Developer Session

1. **Verify Environment**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py shell
   # Test MongoDB connection
   from cards.models import get_mongo_db
   db = get_mongo_db()
   print(db.decks.count_documents({}))
   ```

2. **Current Deck Count**: Should show ~2,466 decks

3. **Priority Tasks**:
   - Start with deck list view implementation
   - Focus on basic deck display before advanced features
   - Test with small dataset before implementing complex queries

4. **Files to Begin With**:
   - `cards/views.py` - Add deck_list function
   - `templates/cards/deck_list.html` - Create basic listing template
   - `cards/urls.py` - Add deck routing

This roadmap provides a clear path forward for transforming the imported deck data into a fully functional deck browsing and analysis system.
