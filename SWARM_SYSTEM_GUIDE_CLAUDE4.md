# üêù EMTEEGEE Swarm System Guide for Claude 4.0

## Overview
The EMTEEGEE project features a sophisticated **AI swarm analysis system** that generates comprehensive MTG card insights using multiple AI "workers" running in parallel. This document provides complete context for Claude 4.0 to understand and enhance the existing swarm architecture.

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Swarm Manager** (`swarm_manager.py`)
   - Orchestrates multiple AI worker processes
   - Manages job distribution and coordination
   - Handles worker lifecycle and health monitoring
   - Implements intelligent load balancing

2. **Analysis Manager** (`analysis_manager.py`)
   - Interfaces between Django views and the swarm system
   - Manages card data and analysis state
   - Coordinates with MongoDB for persistence
   - Provides progress tracking and statistics

3. **Job Queue System** (`job_queue.py`)
   - MongoDB-based job queuing with status tracking
   - Handles job persistence, retries, and cleanup
   - Supports bulk operations and priority queuing
   - Provides comprehensive job statistics and monitoring

4. **Ollama Client** (`ollama_client.py`)
   - Direct interface to local Ollama LLM instances
   - Manages 20 different analysis component types
   - Handles prompt engineering and response parsing
   - Implements error handling and retry logic

### üß¨ Analysis Components (20 Types)

- **Queue Processing**: ~30-60 seconds per component
- **Concurrency**: 2-4 workers optimal for most systems

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Swarm Worker Process Flow:
```python
1. Worker starts ‚Üí Registers with swarm manager
2. Polls job queue for available work
3. Claims job atomically (prevents conflicts)
4. Generates analysis using Ollama LLM
5. Stores result in MongoDB
6. Updates job status and progress
7. Repeats until shutdown signal
```

### Job Queue Schema:
```javascript
{
  "job_id": "uuid",
  "card_uuid": "target_card_id", 
  "job_type": "component_type",
  "status": "pending|processing|completed|failed",
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "claimed_at": "timestamp", 
  "completed_at": "timestamp",
  "worker_id": "worker_identifier",
  "attempts": 0,
  "error_message": "if_failed",
  "priority": 1
}
```

### Analysis Storage Schema:
```javascript
{
  "uuid": "card_id",
  "name": "Card Name",
  "analysis": {
    "components": {
      "tactical_analysis": {"content": "AI_generated_text"},
      "play_tips": {"content": "AI_generated_text"},
      // ... 18 more components
    },
    "component_count": 20,
    "fully_analyzed": true,
    "analysis_completed_at": "timestamp"
  }
}
```
